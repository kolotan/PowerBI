Data visualization is the process of using visual elements like charts, graphs or maps to represent data

Below are the list of visualization elements use for this project with description on use case.

1) Donut Chart - Display the total % un-use balance amount of each department over a period of 4 years.
   Setting Visual
     Legend = [Department]
     Value = [Sum of Balance]
   Setting Format
     Data Labels = {Category, percentage of total}
   
   Can apply on Filters panel, like
   a) top 5 departments using Filter Type = Top N, Top=5, By Value = [Sum of Balance]


2) Card chart - Display a single consolidated balance amount across all departments over a period of 4 years.
   Setting Visual
     Fields = [Sum of Balance]

3) Card chart - Display a single department name having  the top most customer
   Setting Visual
     Fields = [First Department]

4) Stacked bar chart - Display top Account officers across all departments handling most customers
    Setting Visual
      Y-axis = [OfficerName]
      X-axis = [Count of CustID], Count(Distinct)
     
5) Cluster column Chart - display unuse balance amount by each year
    Setting Visual
      X-axis = [Date] hierarchy
      y-axis = [Sum of balance]
   Setting Add further analyses to your visual
      Trend line set to on

4) Slicer - allow user to select which particular year for display affecting all charts within a visual page.
    Setting Visual
      Field = [Year]
    For better visualisation, Setting Visual
      Legend = [Year]

5) Treemap chart, is used to show the parent and child data distribution. This chart
display the actual spending by each department and drill down to subdepartments.
    Setting Visual
      Category = [Department],[Subdepartment]
      Values = [Sum of Actuals]


6) ArcGIS Maps for Power BI - display location of customers using global map and their size of the buble indicating the volumne of customers in that country.
   To turn on ArcGID Maps, go to File->Options and settings->Options.
                           go to Global->Security-> checked on 'ArcGIS for Power BI'. restart PowerBI desktop
   Setting Visual
      Location = [Domicile]
      Size = [Count of CustID], Count(Distinct)
      Colour = [Department]

7) Matrix Chart - To summarize data in a dynamic tabular format. This chart shows by department and drill down to subdepartment for their actual spending amount vs budget amount.
    Setting Visual
      Rows = [Department],[Subdepartment]
      Values = [Sum of Actuals], [Sum of Budget]
  To display alternate row background color, Setting Format-> Visual
      Values -> Alternate background color
  To display bar on value, on Setting Visual->Values->[Sum of Actuals],{Conditional formatting}->{Data bars}
   
8) Clustered column chart - This chart shows the sum of previous year un-use balance amount.
    Setting Visual
      X-axis = [Year]
      y-axis = [PYActual]

9) Line chart - This chart show the unuse balance amount by each year
    Setting Visual
      X-axis = [Date] hierarchy
      y-axis = [Sum of Actual]
   Setting Add further analyses to your visual
      Trend line set to on
      Average line - add line
  
10) Line and stacked column chart - This chart display the unuse balance amount over each year using bar column, and %Growth using line.
    Setting Visual
      X-axis = [Date] hierarchy
      Column y-axis = [Sum of Balance]
      Line y-axis = [%Growth]
   Setting Format-Visual
     Data Labels set to on

11) KPI chart is a visual cue that communicates the amount of progress made toward a measurable goal. This chart shows PYActual for 2019 vs   
    Setting Visual
      Value = [Sum of Actuals]
      Trend axis = [Year]
      Target = [PYActual]
   whereby the [Sum of Actuals] for year 2020 is being display as $4.03M
    and [PYActual] is display as Goal:3.34M (+20.65%)

12) Gauge chart is a circular arc to show how a single value progresses toward a goal or a Key Performance Indicator (KPI).  
    Setting Visual
      Value = [Sum of Actuals]
      Target Value = [PYActual]
    To use the 100% arc of the gauge display
      Setting Visual
      Maximum Value = [Sum of Actuals] 

13) Q&A Chart allow you to explore your data in your own words.
e.g  data's Actuals sorted by data's date 
with the generated chart, you may click on the icon "Turn this Q&A result into a standard visual"

14) The key influencers visual also allows you to understand the relative importance of the different significant factors that it finds.
    Setting Visual
      Analyze = [Revenue]
      Explain by = [Department], [Actuals]
